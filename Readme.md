Goban
=====

A Go Board implemented in Elm, with ambitious goals and functional features.

This project arouse from the need to record Go games while playing Go with my brother. There are already great tools out there one of my favorite being Sabaki, but I still miss some features and conveniences in managing games, also I was looking for a side project to work on in Elm.

This is way from done, but it's functional and is being used almost daily, and thus development will continue.

See Todo for planned features and current progress.


Thanks
